\section*{Abstract}
In this paper we are concerned with estimating the probability of winning an OSCAR Academy \emph{Best Actor/Actress} award. We hypothesize that if actors/actresses were nominated for their performance in a movie that was also nominated for \emph{Best Picture}, then their chances of winning the \emph{Best Actor/Actress} award are higher compared to those who performed in a movie that was not nominated for \emph{Best Picture}. Bayesian framework is used in order to test this hypothesis. Three models are proposed and their performance is evaluated. Probabilities of winning an award for best acting are estimated. The results largely support our hypothesis.

\section*{Introduction}
Watching movies is a big part of the American culture. Every person has his or her preferred janre, story, favorite actors or actresses. People think that they can tell good acting from bad, but do we really judge acting objectively? As laymen, we are probably not objective. But what about professional actors and actresses, the OSCAR academy members for example? Are they being objective when they choose the best actor out of all OSCAR nominees? Suppose that OSCAR academy members are presented with two different movies, movie 1 and movie 2, in which actor 1 and actor 2 perform respectively. The academy members are asked to decide which actor is better. Movie 1 is not particularly interesting, except that actor 1's acting is very good. Movie 2 is exceptionally good, and the acting of actor 2 is as good as of actor 1. The question is: which actor will be perceived as a better one? I first thought of this question while watching the $80^{th}$ OSCAR ceremony of 2007. I was very impressed with the performance of Viggo Mortensen in \emph{Eastern Promises}, but I thought that his chances are not as high as of Daniel Day-Lewis who was nominated for his performance in \emph{There Will Be Blood}, which was also nominated for Best Picture, because the judgement of the academy members can be confounded by the overall impression from these movies. It is also possible that movies nominated for Best Picture are likely to have a larger budget and can hire a better cast. But my personal opinion is there is hardly any difference in talant in OSCAR nominees. It seems more likely that the cast of the movie nominated for Best Picture is more visible to the judges and the its performance is enhanced by the overall impression from the movie. In this work we hypothesize that a Best Actor/Actress (BA) nominee whose movie is also nominated for Best Picture award (BP) has a higher chance of winning this award than an actor/actress from a movie without BP nomination. In the remaining text, we refer to actors and actresses from a BP-nominated movie as a \emph{BP-nominee}. However, a term BP-winner refers to a movie that was awarded with Best Picture OSCAR award. Naturally, a \emph{BA-nominee} is an actor or actress nominated for best actor/actress. We might also use term \emph{BA-movie nominee} when we refer to a movie where the a BA nominee was a cast member.

\subsection*{The data}
The data for each OSCAR ceremony are publicly available (see \cite{oscar_data_base}). The data has to be processed to a proper format before the analysis. We provide the relevant data together with python jupyter file containing the analysis code  (see the \emph{Python} code in the Appendix).

Since the beginning of OSCAR, the nomination categories are different across years, relevant OSCAR categories had to be merged into one. For example, the following categories were used as BP categories:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item BEST MOTION PICTURE
  \item OUTSTANDING MOTION PICTURE
  \item OUTSTANDING PRODUCTION
  \item BEST PICTURE
  \end{enumerate}
  
  For actors and actresses the following categories were used as BA categories:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item ACTOR
  \item ACTOR IN A LEADING ROLE
  \item ACTRESS
  \item ACTRESS IN A LEADING ROLE
\end{enumerate}  
  
  
In order to make things simpler, we only consider actors and actresses nominated for main (rather than supporting) roles. We also excluded years 1928-1932 because during that time more than one actor/actress could win an award. For each year, our data included all movies nominated for BA and whether each of them was also nominated for BP and/or won the BA award.

Because we are interested in association of PB nomination and BA win, we had to have one-to-one correspondence between the BA nominee and the BP nominee. In real data, however, some BA nominees may be from the same movie. For example, in 1935, three actors from \emph{Mutiny on the Bounty} were nominated for best acting performance. After 1935, eleven OSCARs (1944, 1953, 1956, 1958, 1961, 1964, 1969, 1972, 1976, 1983, 1984 ??? check the updated data) had two BA nominees from the same movie. For women, starting from the year 1933,  five OSCARs (1950, 1959, 1977, 1983, 1991 ??? check the updated data) had two BA nominees from the same movie. In this paper, as our main analysis, we treat two BA nominees from the same movie as one. The rationale  behind this choice is that we are only interested if the probability of winning a BA award by at least one of them is higher compared to nominees from a non-BP nominated movie. We also performed a sensitivity analysis, where we treat each BA nominee as if they are all from different movies. We excluded the 6 years for actors and ??? for actresses when either all BA nominees performed in BP nominated movies or none of the BA nominees performed in PB nominated movies. These years are not informative for our analysis because we cannot compare the chances of a BP nominee vs a non-BP nominee in a given year. The remaining data included 79 years for actors and ??? years for actresses.

\subsection*{Notations and definitions}

We introduce the following notations:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $N$ - total number of years ($N=77$)
	\item $i=\{1,...,N\}$ - year index
	\item $P_{W_{BA}|BP, ~i}$ - the probability of winning a BA award given that the movie was nominated for BP.
	\item $n_i$ - number of movies nominated for BA in a given year.
	\item $r_i$ - number of movies out of $n_i$ nominated for BP in a given year ($r_i\leq n_i$).
	\item $\delta_i$ - an indicator variable. $\delta_i=1$ if in year $i$ the movie that won a BA award was also nominated for BP, and $\delta_i=0$ otherwise.
	\item Variables $n_i$ and $r_i$ differ from year to year. We believe that different combinations of $n_i$ and $r_i$ might effect $P_{W_{BA}|BP,~i}$ in different ways. For example, if in a given year there are five BA nominees, and two of them are nominated for BP, the expected probability of winning a BA award while being a BP nominee is $\frac{r_i}{n_i} = \frac{2}{5}$. We call the pair $(r_j,n_j)$ a \emph{pattern} and useindex $j$ to enumerate different patterns. For instance, the pattern of this example is $(2, 5)$.
  % \item Years with the same \emph{pattern} belong to one \emph{cluster}. There are $N_c$ unique \emph{clusters}.
	\item $\left\{i: (r_i,n_i) = (r_j,n_j)\right\}$ - all years with the same pattern (see previous definition), or a \emph{cluster}.
	\item $N_j$ - number of years in a given cluster or a \emph{cluster size}.
	\item $R_j = \sum_{i \in (r_j,n_j)} \delta_i$ - number of years (out of $N_j$) in which the BA award was won by a BP  nominee.
  % \item $n_j$ - number of movies nominated for BA in a given \emph{cluster}
  % \item $r_j$ - number of movies out of $n_i$ nominated for BP in a given \emph{cluster}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Primary hypothesis}
Suppose the nomination for BP did not have any effect on $P_{W_{BA}|BP, ~i}$, then $P_{W_{BA}|BP, ~i}$ would have depended only on the prevalence of BP nominees among BA nominees for a given year. In other words, $P_{W_{BA}|BP, ~i}$ would have been equal to $\frac{r_i}{n_i}$. We hypothesize that a BA nominee whose movie is also a BP nominee has a higher chance of winning a BA award than a BA nominee without BP nomination, therefore our \emph{null} and primary hypotheses are:

\begin{align*}
	H_0:&~~~P_{W_{BA}|BP,~i} = \frac{r_i}{n_i}\\
	H_1:&~~~P_{W_{BA}|BP,~i} > \frac{r_i}{n_i}\\
\end{align*}

Our very simple data summary shows (see Table \ref{table:goal1}) that the observed probability of winning a BA award seems to be higher than the expected probability.\\

\section*{Analysis plan}
\label{secAnalysisPlan}
Many different approaches can be used to test the main hypothesis. We focus here on the Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach because it allows us to incorporate prior believes and it allows to model clusters differently, while modeling clusters as a whole. We estimate $\theta_j={P}_{W_{BA}|BP,~j}$ using the following models:

~\\
\begin{enumerate}
	\item\textbf{Model I}:
		\begin{align*}
			R_j &\sim Binomial(\theta_j, N_j)\\
			\theta_j &\sim Beta(\alpha, \beta)\\
			\alpha &\sim Gamma(2, 1),~with~mean~2\\
			\beta &\sim Gamma(2, 1),~with~mean~2\\
		\end{align*}
		

	\item\textbf{Model II}:
		\begin{align*}
			R_j &\sim Binomial\left(\theta_j, N_j \right)\\
			\theta_j &=\frac{1}{1+e^{- \alpha_j}},~\text{where}\\
			\alpha_j &\sim N(\mu, \tau)\\
			\mu &\sim N(0, sd=100)\\
			\tau &\sim Gamma(100, rate=100)\\
		\end{align*}
		

  \item\textbf{Model III}: 
		\begin{align*}
			R_j &\sim Binomial\left(\theta_j, N_j \right)\\
			\theta_j &=\frac{1}{1+e^{-C_j - \gamma_j}},~\text{where}~~~C_j = -log\left(\frac{n_j}{r_j}-1\right)\\
			\gamma_j &\sim N(\mu, \tau)\\
			\mu &\sim N(0, sd=100)\\
			\tau &\sim Gamma(100, rate=100)\\
		\end{align*}
		
  \item\textbf{Model IV}: 
		\begin{align*}
			R_j &\sim Binomial\left(\theta_j, N_j \right)\\
			\theta_j &=\frac{1}{1+e^{-c_j - \gamma_j}}\\
      c_j &\sim Beta(\alpha = r_j, \beta = n_j - r_j)\\
			\gamma_j &\sim N(\mu, \tau)\\
			\mu &\sim N(0, sd=100)\\
			\tau &\sim Gamma(100, rate=100)\\
		\end{align*}
		

\end{enumerate}

All three models have slightly different approaches to modeling the probability of winning a BA award. In the first model, this probability is Beta-distributed. The problem with the first model is that the distribution of $\theta_j$ has a mean of $1/2$, which means that all estimates will be shrunk toward $1/2$ not matter what the pattern is. The second model is similar to the first, except that the probability is modeled with inverse logit distribution. We included both of these models in order to see how our distributional assumptions affect our results. In addition of shrinking the cluster probabilities toward the middle, these two models also do not utilize the cluster specific information. Specifically, they do not take into account that in a year with, say, $3$ nominees for BP out of $5$ nominees for BA, the expected probability of winning the OSCAR while being nominated for BP is $3/5$. In model III, however, this expected probability is taken into account in the following way. The probability of winning is modeled as an inverse logit function $\theta_j =\frac{1}{1+e^{-C_j - \gamma_j}}$, where parameter $\gamma_j$ represents the deviation from the null hypothesis and constant $C_j = -log\left(\frac{n_j}{r_j}-1\right)$ is chosen in such way that when the null hypothesis is true $(\gamma_j = 0)$, the probability of winning BA given BP equals to the expected probability:


\begin{align*}
	\theta_j =\frac{1}{1+e^{-C_j}} = \frac{1}{1+e^{log\left(\frac{n_j}{r_j}-1\right)}} =  \frac{1}{1+\frac{n_j}{r_j}-1}  = \frac{r_j}{n_j} \\
\end{align*}

Model IV is similar to Model III, but instead of constant $C_j$ it has a random variable that is distributed is such way that under the null hypothesis, its mean is $\frac{r_j}{n_j}$. We introduced Model IV as a more flexible version of Model III. Note that for all three models, the deviation from the null can be in either direction so the fact that our hypothesis is one-sided does not affect the results. We test the null hypothesis by computing the probabilities of interest, $\hat{\theta}_j$, and their credible intervals for each pattern. For model III, we also test the hypothesis for all patterns by computing the mean and the credible intervals for parameter $\mu$, the mean of the distributions for $\gamma_j$. For all three models, we also report odds ratios (ORs), $\widehat{OR}_j$, which are computed as the ratio of the observed odds and the expected odds of winning BA while being nominated for BP:

\begin{align*}
	\widehat{OR}_j =  \frac{\hat{\theta}_j}{1 - \hat{\theta}_j}  \bigg/  \frac{R_j/N_j}{1 - R_j/N_j} \\
\end{align*}


The credible intervals were computed as $0.025^{th}$ and $0.975^{th}$ percentiles of the corresponding posterior distributions. For all model $1000$ sampling iterations were performed with $5000$ iterations of tuning. All models were assessed for convergence and fit (see XXX???). Programming language \texttt{Python}[1] and library \texttt{pymc3} were used for all computations; the code is provided in the AppendixXXX???.

\section*{Results}
Fig S1~\ref{S1_Fig} and Fig S2~\ref{S2_Fig} show the result of the main analysis for actors and actresses respectively. Each panel displays the mean estimate of the probability of winning and its credible intervals for all three models (from left to right). The figure demonstrates that for the cluster size of $10$ or higher, being nominated for BP increases the odds of winning the BA award by roughly $300\%$. Model III also supported our hypothesis for much smaller clusters with expected probability of winning of $2/4$, $2/3$, and $4/5$  (see Fig S1~\ref{S1_Fig}, panels (C), (E), and (G)). %The estimated ORs are presented in Table XXX???.

\section*{Discussion}
In this paper we estimated the odds of winning the Best Actor award while being nominated for Best Picture relatively to the odds of winning Best Actor by chance. For larger sample size and certain prevalence of BP nomination our analysis supports the hypothesis that being nominated for BP improves the odds of winning a BA award. 
Our approach has several limitations. The models did not account for other nominations. Also, for actors from the same movie, we either assumed that there is only one actor or that two actors are from different movies. In our future work we plan to remedy this limitation by introducing clustering by movie. 
The evidence in favor or our primary hypothesis was not uniform across clusters. One possible reason was that different clusters had different sample size. It also seems that the more actors/actresses are nominated for best pictures the less this nomination seems to influence the probability of winning an award for best acting. This seems to make sense: if all performers were from BP-nominated movies this nomination would not matter. If only one or two out of five BA nominees were also BP nominees this could possible make their performance stand out more.

\section*{Conclusion}

Overall, there is some evidence that being part of the movie nominated for best picture increases chances of winning an award for best acting. As we noted in our discussion  evidence however, this evidence is not uniform across clusters.
